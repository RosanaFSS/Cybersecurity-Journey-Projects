<h1>Wireshark for Packet Capture: Analyze web traffic</h1>
<h2>Cybersecurity Project</h2>

<h3>Project Scenario</h3>
<p>Role : <code>Network Security Analyst</code><br><br>
Problem: <code>Network performance issues are impacting user experience, including slow website loading times and application responsiveness</code>.<br><br>
My Task: <code>Investigate potentital sources of network issues</code>.</p>

<br>

<h3>Project Structure</h3>
  
- Exploring Wireshark’s Interface – Learn how to set up and navigate Wireshark efficiently.

- Capturing, Filtering, and Saving Traffic – Perform live captures and apply filters to isolate key data.

- HTTP & Web Traffic Analysis – Analyze HTTP requests, responses, and headers for web communication insights.

- DNS & Network Discovery – Capture DNS queries, investigate response times, and detect anomalies.

- TCP/IP & Performance Analysis – Examine the TCP handshake, measure latency, and identify performance bottlenecks.</p>

<br>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>
  
- Navigate Wireshark’s Interface – Understand the key features and options within Wireshark.<br>

- Capture and Filter Network Traffic – Perform live captures and apply filtering techniques to focus on relevant data.<br>

- Analyze HTTP and Web Traffic – Interpret HTTP requests and responses to diagnose web communication issues.<br>

- Investigate DNS Traffic – Examine DNS resolution processes and identify potential misconfigurations or threats.<br>

- Evaluate TCP Performance Metrics – Analyze TCP handshake sequences, retransmissions, and latency to assess network health. By the end of this course, you will be able to capture and analyze network traffic effectively, troubleshoot performance issues, and identify security threats using Wireshark. </p>
